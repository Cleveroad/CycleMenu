## Meet CycleMenu for Android by Cleveroad

What can be better than an eye-catching design in couple with reasonable features? While using this menu you do not need to worry about the lack of space for some useful features since the scroll type can be endless as well as basic. Choose an appropriate corner, customize your icons and here you go!

During its development, we have created a custom LayoutManager for the inner RecyclerView in order to display the elements in a circle with the possibility to scroll them.

In case you are in need of beautiful and functional app menu, you are welcome to use CycleMenu. Make your scroll last forever!
